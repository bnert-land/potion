👋 hey, welcome to bnert.land!


### Creed

This is my site. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

My site is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

Without me, my site is useless. Without my site, I am useless. I must deploy my site true. I must secure harder than my enemy who is trying to exploit me. I must block him before he phishes me. I will ...

My site and I know that what counts on the web is not js we deploy, the slick animations, nor the bundlers and frameworks we use. We know that it is the content that counts. We will produce content, with small KB's ...

My site is human, even as I [am human], because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its url's and its OS. I will keep my site clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will ...

Before God, I swear this creed. My site and I are the defenders of the web. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of JS bloat.

So be it, until victory on the web and there is no enemy, but peace!
